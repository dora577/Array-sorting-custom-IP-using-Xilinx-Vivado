# Array-sorting-custom-IP-using-Xilinx-Vivado
The project aims to create the custom IP using Xilinx Vivado, which would sort the array of the size of up to 1024 in ascending order.
The IP was created for the Zedboard with Xilinx ZynqÂ®-7000 All Programmable SoC. The drivers for the user interface are in the "C codes" folder, while the FPGA part of the project was realized using the Verilog hardware description language and is presented in the IP folder.
The main logic of the project and the finite state machine diagram is presented in the "Embed_proj_report.pdf" file
